# PPP-Protocal
Project Overview

This project implements a secure, privacy-preserving communication protocol for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The primary goal of this system is to secure communication between IoT devices and a server, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. By using lightweight encryption techniques, this project optimizes performance while meeting the security requirements of IoT applications.

##Key Features

ChaCha20 Encryption: A lightweight, high-performance encryption algorithm that is well-suited for resource-constrained IoT devices. It encrypts data in transit, ensuring confidentiality while maintaining low power consumption.

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH): A key exchange protocol that facilitates secure generation of shared keys between devices and the server, enabling symmetric encryption for data confidentiality.

HMAC for Integrity: A Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) ensures that the data received has not been tampered with during transmission.

MQTT Protocol: A lightweight messaging protocol used for secure communication between IoT devices and the server. MQTT ensures efficient data transmission with minimal overhead.

##Architecture

The architecture consists of a Raspberry Pi-based IoT device, which communicates with a server using MQTT. The IoT device generates sensor data, encrypts it using ChaCha20, performs key exchange with the server using ECDH, and transmits the encrypted data over MQTT. The server then decrypts the data, verifies its integrity using HMAC, and processes it for further action.

##Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python 3.xChallenges Faced

Efficient encryption and decryption on resource-constrained devices.

Secure and lightweight key exchange for maintaining session integrity without compromising performance.

Ensuring MQTT broker configuration for secure communication.

##Future Work

Extend the protocol to handle more complex IoT systems with a larger number of devices.

Investigate post-quantum cryptographic solutions for future-proofing against quantum computing threats.
